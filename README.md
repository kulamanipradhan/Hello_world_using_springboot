# Spring Boot Hello World Application

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates the basic setup to display a "Hello, World!" message. It serves as a minimal example to help you get started with Spring Boot.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to run the "Hello, World!" Spring Boot application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-hello-world.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or use a command-line tool like Maven to build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   You can run the application using your IDE or with the following Maven command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Access the "Hello, World!" Message**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You will see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.

## Customizing the Message

If you want to customize the "Hello, World!" message, you can do so by modifying the `application.properties` file or the application code. In this example, the message is hard-coded in the `HelloController.java` class.

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

Simply change the message in the `hello()` method to your desired text.

  - `HelloController.java`: Defines a Spring MVC controller for serving the "Hello, World!" message.
- `src/main/resources/`: Contains configuration files.
  - `application.properties`: Stores application-specific properties (e.g., server port).
